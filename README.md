# React Router Custom Framework

This completely-not-production-ready "framework" example shows how to integrate React Router with custom bundling and server abstractions instead of using `@react-router/dev`.

## Running the app

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm  start
```

## Goofing around with the app

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## Caveats

I whipped this together REALLY quickly, it certainly has errors and could be more thorough, but I hope it helps!
