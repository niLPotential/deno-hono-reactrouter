# React Router Custom Framework

This completely-not-production-ready "framework" example shows the touch-points you can use with React Router to build your bundling and server abstractions around it like `@react-router/dev` does.

## Running the app

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm  start
```

## Goofing around with the app

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## Caveats

I whipped this together REALLY quickly, it certainly has errors and could be more thorough, but I hope it helps!
